# Algorithm Analysis

We evaluate the performance of an algorithm in terms of its input size.

- **Time Complexity** - Amount of time taken by the algorithm to run, as a function of input size.
- **Space Complexity** - Amount of memory taken by the algorithm to run, as a function of input size.

By evaluating against the input size, the analysis is not only machine independent but the comparison is also more appropriate.

## How to represent Complexity

#### Asymptotic Notations

- Mathematical tools to represent time and space complexity

1. Big-O Notation (O-notation) - Worst case complexity
2. Omega Notation (Ω-notation) - Best case complexity
3. Theta Notation (Θ-notation) - Average case complexity
