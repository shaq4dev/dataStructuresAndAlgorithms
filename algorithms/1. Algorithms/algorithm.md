# What is an algorithm?

- An algorithm is a set of well defined instructions to solve a particular problem.

## Characteristics of an algorithm

Eg. An algorithm to add 2 numbers:

- An algorithm must have _**"well defined"**_ inputs and outputs.

  - input: 'a' and 'b'
  - output: Sum of 'a' and 'b'

- Each step in an algorithm must be clear and unambiguous.

  - Add numbers using '+'
  - Return the value

- An algorithm should be language independent, it should be written in such a way that it can be written with a different programming languages.

## Why Algorithms?

- As a developer you will come accros problems that you need to solve.
- Learning algorithms translates to learning different techniques to efficiently solve those problems
- One problem can be solved in many ways using different algorithms.
- Every algorithm comes with its own trade off when it comes to performance.
